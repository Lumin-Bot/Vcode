                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>Over the last half-decade, Imagine Dragons have emerged as one of the biggest 
                and most compelling rock bands in the world. Within a year of its June 2017 release,
                their third studio album EVOLVE went double-platinum, yielding three back-to-back 
                #1 singles: “Believer,” “Thunder,” and “Whatever It Takes.”  In the midst of their 
                Evolve World Tour—a 116 date trek that sold over 1.7 million tickets worldwide—the 
                multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning band began working on their follow-up, and 
                ended up creating their most dynamic work to date.</p>

                <p>Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their limitless passion and 
                genre-bending sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that 
                quickly earned a grassroots following. After hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid signed 
                them to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope, the band made their major-label debut with 
                Continued Silence, a 2012 EP featuring the double-platinum breakthrough single 
                “Its Time.” With their full-length debut Night Visions arriving later that year,
                Imagine Dragons found themselves on a skyward trajectory that saw the album debut
                at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling more than five million copies worldwide. 
                In addition, Night Visions diamond-selling single “Radioactive” hit No. 1 on 
                the Billboard Rock chart and won Best Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards. 
                From there, Imagine Dragons went on to see their 2015 sophomore album Smoke + 
                Mirrors debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Released in June 2017, their third 
                album EVOLVE was nominated for a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album and spawned 
                three No. 1 Alternative radio hits: “Believer,” which topped the Alternative 
                radio chart for 12 weeks and also climbed to No. 3 at Top 40 radio; “Thunder,” 
                which hit No. 1 at Top 40 and  scored a Best Pop Duo/Group Performance Grammy 
                nomination; and “Whatever It Takes,” which was Top 5 at Top 40 radio.</p>
